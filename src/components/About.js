                                Hi! My name is Jordan Lamoreaux and I am a self-taught full-stack web developer based in Austin, TX.
                                I currently work for a company that provides custom websites for K-12 schools built on our in-house CMS software.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Having spent many years in customer-facing roles, I take a customer-first approach to my work.
                                I am a motivated student, having learned both American Sign Language and Web Development outside of a classroom,
                                I appreciate the value of critical thinking and using as many educational resources available to us as possible.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When Iâ€™m not debugging code, I am spending time with <a href="http://penelopelamore.com">my wife</a> and my baby daughter.
